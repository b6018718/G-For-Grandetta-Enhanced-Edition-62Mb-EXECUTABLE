On windows 10
1. Start Bluetooth
2. Select Add Device
3. Select Bluetooth: Mice, keyboards, pens or audio and other kinds of bluetooth devices
4. Hold the sync button on a side ways left joycon until it appears on the pc
5. Press connect and run the game

Any controller should work but I've only tested using Nintendo JoyCons
