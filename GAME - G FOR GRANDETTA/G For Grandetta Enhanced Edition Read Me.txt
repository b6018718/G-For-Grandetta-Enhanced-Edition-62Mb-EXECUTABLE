1. Game Description

G For Grandetta is a turn-based role playing game, a genre
notable for its intense stories with highly strategic battles, and G For
Grandetta is no different!

The game begins when you, the hero, awake from slumber to find your 
once bustling village is completely devoid of life. The exception
being a lone stray dog standing atop the grave of your late grandma...

3. Game Flow

The game can be split into two distinct gameplay sections, the first is the
overworld. Here you gather information from Non Playable Characters(NPCs),
buy & sell potions, open treasure chests, and advance the story. While
you are moving around in the overworld outside of towns there is a chance
you will be attacked by a wild beast!

If this happens you will be transported to the second section of gameplay,
the battle screen. In battles the objective is to reduce the enemies Hit 
Points (HP) to zero without the enemy doing so to you first. If you win 
you will receive some gold, Experience Points (EXP) and the enemy has a 
chance to drop a potion. If you lose you are transported back to your bed 
back at the village, your health will be restored to full however you will
lose half of your gold.

When you have gained enough EXP you will level up, this increases your 
stats making you stronger and giving you access to different types of magic.

					STATS
Hit Points (HP)  – This is your health, it can be restored via healing magic
                   and potions.
Mana Points (MP) – This allows you to cast magic, more powerful spells 
                   require more MP.
Physical Attack  – This affects how much damage your standard attack does
                   to the enemy
Magic Attack     – This affects how much damage your spells does to the enemy
Physical Defence – This affects how much enemy physical attacks deplete your HP
Magic Defence    – This affects how much enemy magic attacks deplete your HP
Luck             – This affects your ability to run away and score critical
                   hits, a critical hit will do twice as much damage


You and the enemy will take turns choosing commands until only one of
you is left standing. To beat your opponent you have four commands at
your disposal.
					COMMANDS
Attack           – A standard move performed at no MP cost
Magic            – Allows you to select a spell, these are strong but
                   consume MP
Use Items        – Allows you to select a potion to drink
Run Away         – The hero attempts to escape from the beast

  bosses
